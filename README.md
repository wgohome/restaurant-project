# Restaurant Reservation and Point of Sale System

A Java CLI application for CZ2002 Assignment

Notes:

- Delete all .dat files if there are issues running the program after rearraging files or making more objects. Need to reserialize after

- Do not close scanner outside the main, may cause issues when we want to read form the System.in buffer again. Use app.RestaurantApp.SC as the constant scanner variable instead.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
